# Debt Snowball

## Function
Uses the Dave Ramsey "Debt Snowball" method to project how long it will take to pay off your loans. This method assumes that you will pay the same amount towards all your loans for the entire time that you are paying them off. You will pay the minimum amount towards all of your loans and any excess will go towards paying off your smallest loan.

### Therefore...
This will...
1. Sort your loans from smallest to largest
2. Ask you how much you want to pay per month in total until the loans are paid off
3. Make minimum payments towards all loans and apply the remainder to the smallest loan
4. Project how many months it will take to pay off all loans

## Usage
You are free to take the code and use it however you wish.
